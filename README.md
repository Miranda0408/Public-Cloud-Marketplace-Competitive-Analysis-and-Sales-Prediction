# Public Cloud Marketplace Competitive Analysis and Sales Prediction

## Introduction

In the domestic market, Aliyun, Tencent Cloud, and Huawei Cloud have established versatile marketplaces offering a wide range of enterprise-level solutions, including infrastructure, security, AI, IoT, and more.

This project aims to analyze the competitive capabilities of these cloud service providers in terms of product types, pricing, delivery methods, and other factors. Additionally, it seeks to predict sales based on these features.

Through this analysis, we can gain clear insights into the current status and future trends of the public cloud marketplace. Furthermore, we can provide recommendations to companies seeking to procure cloud services.

## Overview

This project is conducted through the following steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Data Modeling and Prediction

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

In Data Collection and Preprocessing, our approach includes:

1. Identifying the target cloud service providers: Aliyun, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, eSurfing Cloud, Kingsoft Cloud, and QingCloud.
2. Reviewing their websites' `robots.txt` files to verify permissions for web scraping.
3. Analyzing the structure and interconnections of their web pages to determine the relevant information and appropriate scraping techniques.
4. Developing a Python script to scrape the websites and preprocess the collected data, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and data type inconsistencies.
